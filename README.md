# Titanic Dataset Analysis with Python

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook to understand passenger demographics and survival rates.

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Titanic_Analysis.ipynb`) that walks through a step-by-step analysis of the Titanic dataset. The notebook is designed to be self-explanatory, with detailed comments explaining each line of code.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the well-known Titanic dataset, which includes passenger information such as:

-   PassengerId
-   Survived (Target Variable)
-   Pclass (Passenger Class)
-   Name
-   Sex
-   Age
-   SibSp (Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard)
-   Parch (Number of Parents/Children aboard)
-   Ticket
-   Fare
-   Cabin
-   Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

The raw data is provided in Excel format (`titanic/`) within this repository. The dataset was downloaded from an open source on Google.

## Tools and Libraries

-   Python 3.x
-   Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab)
-   Pandas
-   NumPy
-   Matplotlib
-   Seaborn

## Getting Started

### Google Colab (Recommended)

1.  Open the `Titanic_Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2.  Upload the `titanic` folder containing the Excel files to the Colab environment's file section.
3.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially.

### Local Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

2.  Navigate to the cloned directory.

3.  Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
    ```

4.  Open the Jupyter notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Titanic_Analysis.ipynb
    ```

5.  Run the cells in the notebook.

## Analysis Performed

The notebook covers the following analysis steps:

-   **Data Loading and Inspection:** Loading the dataset from Excel and inspecting its structure.
-   **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, converting data types, and removing irrelevant columns.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    -   Analyzing survival rates by gender, passenger class, and age.
    -   Visualizing the distribution of numerical and categorical features.
    -   Exploring correlations between features.
-   **Feature Engineering (Optional):** Creating new features to improve analysis.
-   **Data Visualization:** Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative plots and charts.
-   **Drawing Conclusions:** Summarizing the key findings and insights.
